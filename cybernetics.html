		There's an easy answer to the boundary problem. The cell, the organ, the body, they all end at their membranes, their skin.
		The only issue is that the easy answer is completely wrong. A mitochondrion is capable of extending beyond the membrane,
		by taking in glucose and producing energy. By doing this, its environment, the cytosol, becomes an extension of itself. 
		The same holds true with cells: Each cell extends deep into the extracellular matrix. A new picture of the membrane starts
		to emerge. Rather than being a line, the membrane becomes a liminal vector field.
