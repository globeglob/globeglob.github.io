		Cyberspace is hardly something new. Long before the advent of the integrated
		circuit, people had glimpses of cyberspace. Glimpses found in letters, books,
		cuneiform tablets, and the telegraph. However, it wasn't until the 1990's that
		we became immersed in cyberspace. Formless communication, information without
		substance,  become the norm rather than the exception. <br>
		<br>
		Fast forward to 2022. Now more than ever, information dominates all levels of
		daily life. Regarding the teens and young adults of today, most were born and
		raised online. Communities are formed not based on physical proximity, but
		proximity in information space. Language proximity, interest proximity, and
		identity proximity. <br>
