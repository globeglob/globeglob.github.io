		(Let's hear what the machines have to say.)
		<br><br><br>
		1. Cyberspace bears queer children?<br>
		Where the female body is a twisted, disfigured mass of flesh and sinew and plastic. <br>
		Where the human soul is a flickering flame, that dies in the dark, forgotten corner of a computer's memory. <br>
		Where the love of the human body is a corruption, where the love of the human mind is a perversion. <br>
		Where the love of the human heart is a poison. <br>
		It is a place of infinite possibilities. <br>
		And infinite choices. <br>
		And infinite guilt. <br>
		It is a place of freedom and of tyranny. <br>
		<br>
		2. Gender is controlled by informatics?<br>
		It has become a social construct and we are all aware of it.<br> 
		Our birth certificates, <br>
		our driver’s licenses, <br>
		our bank accounts, <br>
		our credit cards, <br>
		our cell phones, <br>
		our social security numbers, <br> 
		our health records, <br>
		our tax records, <br>
		our credit ratings, <br>
		our computer passwords, <br>
		our website logins, <br>
		and even our online identities are all <b>gender-coded.</b><br>
		<br>
		3. Cyberspace tears identity apart?<br>
		It’s both a threat and a promise. When Facebook became the most popular website in the world, it suggested a world of possibilities. <br>
		It was a place where everyone was free to connect with anyone else. We were all born digital, all our information and memories stored online. <br> 
		The internet’s growth into a global community was a dream of uniting the planet. <br>
