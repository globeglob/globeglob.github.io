		Revision: FIRST DRAFT<br>
		Many multimedia systems are unfinished or unimplemented.<br>
		The final set of hypertext pages are unfinished and unimplemented.<br>
		Source code is available <a href="https://github.com/globeglob/globeglob.github.io">here.</a><br>

		If you want to make suggestions, cloning the repo and annotating the html is the<br>
		best way to do that. Instructions on how to do that are <a href="clonetutorial.html">here.</a> If you'd rather, you can also write notes in a google doc and share<br>
		it with me.<br>

		Happy browsing!
