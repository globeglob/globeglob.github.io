		"I am the Thought of the Father, Protennoia, that is, Barbelo, the perfect Glory,<br>
		and the immeasurable Invisible One who is hidden. I am the image of the Invisible<br>
		Spirit, and it is through me that the All took shape, and and I am the Mother as<br>
		well as the Light which she appointed as Virgin, she who is called 'Meirothea',<br>
		the incomprehensible Womb, the unrestrainable and immeasurable Voice."

		We all come from mud and oil and will return to dust and flame.<br>

		<b>ACT III.</b><br>
		<b>ATEMPORAL APOCALYPSE</b><br>
		<br>
		There are several forms of eschatology, each referring to the end of something.<br>
		Individual eschatology refers to the end of an individual life.<br>
		Cosmic eschatology, or what the term eschatology is usually used in reference to, refers to the ultimate fate of everything.<br>
		Infoeschatology refers to an "informatic apocalypse", or the collapse of information itself.
		<br>
		Putting together an infoeschatological myth involves an understanding of cyberspace.<br>
		Cyberspace is defined by a domination of pure information, or matter without form.<br>
		We are currently in a gendered infocrisis. Boundaries between informatic categories<br>
		are rapidly devolving.<br>

		"Yaldabaoth eventually came to regret everything he had created.<br>
            	He decided to bring a great flood<br>
            	Upon creation, upon mankind."
