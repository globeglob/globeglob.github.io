		(<i>trans</i> as in transgressive)<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		The term Transgender is described in Susan Stryker's paper Biopolitics<br>
		as "anything that calls attention to the contigency and unnaturalness<br> 
		of gender normativity". Using this definition, we can construct a<br>
		definition for Transbiology: anything that calls attention to the<br>
		incongruity of Bio/logics. Bio/Logics is a form of biologism, defined<br>
		by Sari M. Van Anders in Bio/logics as “implicit and/or explicit reasoning<br> 
		guides informed by features thought to be natural, corporeal, evolved,<br>
		material (e.g., sex over gender).” The transgender body is inherently<br>
		transbiological, as is a non-heterosexual romantic or sexual relationship.<br>
		An embryo produced through IVF is transbiological, as is the pinnacle of<br>
		transbiology: the <b>Cyborg</b>.<br>
		<br> 
		Through the process of disrupting Bio/logics, the cyborg body and the<br>
		transgender body become sisters.<br>
