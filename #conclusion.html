		(the ultimate fate of the membrane-bound self)<br>
		<br>
		Humanity has two origin myths and two eschatologies.<br>
		We come from mud and we come from oil.<br>
		We return to dust and we return to fire.<br>
		<br>
		Its root is bitter
		Its branches are dead.
            	Its shadow is hatred
            	Its leaves are deception
		The nectar of wickedness is in its blossoms.
         	Its fruit is death
            	Its seed is desire
		It flowers in the darkness.
            Those who eat from it are denizens of Hades
            Darkness is their resting place.
