		(Who we tell people we are)
		<br><br>
		I was born in Omaha, but I'm from a small town called Valentine, Nebraska.<br>
		I've lived in Valentine my entire life.<br>
		<br>
		It was July 3, 2002.<br>
		I was fourteen years old.<br>
		<br>
		My dad brought home a computer from work.<br>
		It was an IBM desktop from 1999.<br>
		<br>
		He plugged in the computer and it beeped.<br>
		The air filled with the hum of fans and the smell of dust.<br>
		<br>
		I watched him set it up for hours on end.<br>
		I didn't understand anything he typed into the terminal.<br>
		<br>
		By the time August rolled around, I knew how to use it on my own.<br>
		I loved that machine, and I loved what I could make it do.<br>
		<br>
		One day in early October, there was a van parked in front of my house.<br>
		It was the first thing I saw when I got home from school.<br>
		<br>
		My computer had incredible new abilities.<br>
		Therefore, so did I.<br>
		<br>
		I could communicate with anyone else on Earth, no matter how far away.<br>
		Provided they had a computer, of course.<br>
		<br>
		I met so many new, unique people, and learned so many incredible things.<br>
		And then I encountered an infohazard: a piece of information that worked its way into my brain.<br>
		<br>
		I had always been uncomfortable in my own skin, that's why the computer was incredible.<br>
		It extended my body beyond the confines of my skin and gave me a safe place to go.<br>
		<br>
		This infohazard taught me that my body wasn't as static as people taught me.<br>
		Not only could I change the part of my body outside my skin, I could change the part inside as well.<br>
		<br>
		I wanted to peel back the membranes that enclosed me and embrace my new identity.<br>
		My new identity as multiplicitous, cybernetic, and non-individual.<br>
		<br>
		My new identity as a woman.
